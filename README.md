# TOXIC-SENTENCE-CLASSIFICATION
Using SVM , Logistic Regression pipelines and in tensorflow.
## Model Maker's average word embedding algorithm 
 (https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker/text_classification), trained on a custom dataset of almost 2 thousands classified comments from Youtube and 3other sources. I trained the original Python model using Google Colab, then converted it in the TensorFlowJS format to be used in the browser. The entire model is just **199KB**, which makes it very lightweight.
